1.04

	fixed rt.cpan.org#75145. uninitialized fields lead to
        program abort. solved by pre-initializing them in the
        new records method. types notes and groups affected.

	fixed rt.cpan.org#75146. mtime will only modified if
	the passwd field changed. POD adjusted. Fix suggested
	by Luca Filipozzi - thx.


1.03
	after saving we do not mv the tmp file but copying
	it, because mv sometimes doesn't work with files the
	current user is not the owner but has write permissions
	while cp works on such files. so now we cp and unlink
	the tmpfile after saving.


1.02
	doc fix in ::Record (group separator is . not /)
	added Shell.pm to Makefile.PL dependencies


1.01
	bug fix in t/run.t


1.00
	initial version
